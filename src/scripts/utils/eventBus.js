/**
 * @class EventBus
 * @description Implements the publish-subscribe pattern, allowing for decoupled communication
 * between different parts of the application. Components can subscribe to specific events
 * and react when those events are published, without needing direct references to each other.
 * It is highly recommended to use event names defined in the {@linkcode EVENTS} enum.
 *
 * @example
 * // How to use the eventBus:
 * import { eventBus, EVENTS } from './eventBus.js';
 *
 * // Subscriber
 * const handleProgramOpen = (data) => {
 *   console.log('Program open requested:', data.programId, 'with data:', data);
 * };
 * const unsubscribeOpenHandler = eventBus.subscribe(EVENTS.PROGRAM_OPEN, handleProgramOpen);
 *
 * // Publisher
 * eventBus.publish(EVENTS.PROGRAM_OPEN, { programId: 'notepad', someValue: 123 });
 *
 * // To clean up a specific subscription (e.g., when a component is destroyed or no longer needs to listen):
 * unsubscribeOpenHandler();
 *
 * @see {@linkcode EVENTS} for a list of standard event names.
